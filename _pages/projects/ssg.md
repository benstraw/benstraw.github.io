A static site generator is the technology used to generate the flat html files for this website.  They have become more popular in recent years due to their scalability and ease of set up.  This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I choose Jekyll for it's intimate connection with GitHub (it's creator [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner) was also one of the founders of GitHub), and the ease of getting it setup on the platform.  I've since done more research on SSG's and am considering migration to another platform.

# Top Static Site Generators of 2023

Static site generators have revolutionized the way developers build websites. They offer an efficient and effective way to build sites that are fast, secure, and easy to maintain. In 2023, the top three static site generators are Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is an open-source static site generator known for its speed and flexibility. It boasts a site generation time of less than 1ms per page and supports unlimited content types. Hugo includes more than 300 themes, enabling you to find the perfect look for your site, and it also ships with templates that can handle common site-building tasks like SEO optimization and adding analytics. Hugo supports markdown syntax, shortcodes, and multiple output formats, making it a versatile choice. However, it uses the Go programming language, which could be a barrier for those unfamiliar with it[^1][^2].

[Pelican](https://getpelican.com) is another free, open-source static site generator that relies on the popular Python programming language and Jinja for templating and themes. Pelican enables users to create content in reStructuredText or Markdown, and its static output can be hosted anywhere. It also offers a modular plugin system that enables hundreds of extra features for your sites. On the downside, it requires Python to be installed on your device, which might not be ideal for some users[^3][^4].

Lastly, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a long-standing static site generator that is popular for its straightforward structure and great documentation. It can import content from multiple sources and uses the Liquid template language to deploy different themes and extras on your sites. Companies like Spotify, Twitch, and Netflix use Jekyll to produce pages quickly and effectively, adding to its credibility. However, Jekyll may not be as in-depth as some other tools, which could limit its functionality for some users[^5][^6].

Each of these static site generators offers its unique features, pros, and cons, making them suited to different kinds of projects. Consider your specific needs and skills when choosing a static site generator for your next web development project.
